# Features
## navigation-bar
Navigation bar will be responsive for different screen size.

I'll use bootstrap to do so.
 * Desktop
  
   ![Navbar_Desktop](/docs/Navbar_full.png)

   In tablet and mobie bootstrap is used to give a responsive reaction to the bar.

 * Tablet
  
    ![Navbar_Tablet](/docs/Navbar_tablet.png)

 * Mobile
  
    ![Navbar_Mobile](/docs/Navbar_mobile.png)


## hero-page

  The hero page take the first central page in desktop and tablet, adapting it self with bootstrap. 

  I also add a transition backwards.

## card-section

I will have a Meal section, I want to create some cards that will be reponsive on the three format thanks to bootstrap.

* Desktop

  ![Desktop_card](/docs/card_desktop.png)


* Tablet
  
    ![Tablet_card](/docs/tablet_card.png)


* Mobile

    ![Mobile_card](/docs/mobile_card.png)


## benefit-section

The section will be divided in 4  box, two with picture and two with text and background color to create good symmetry, on Desktop and tablet. 

On mobile I will have 4 boxes in line.

## varieties-section

This section will use the same principle of boxes of the benefit section, with 6 boxes in line of 3, becoming in line of 2 on mobile.

  ![Varieties](/docs/varieties.png)

  ![Varieties](/docs/varieties_mobile.png)

## contact-section

* Desktop

   ![Contact_us-desktop](/docs/contact-us-desktop.png)

# Testing

* During all the Development stage I used [DevTools - Chrome for Developers](<https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools>), to allow see how the website was looking on the browser. Then I readapt margin, padding, class name ( considering using Bootstrap ) to what I fell it's most visual apeealing. 

* I noticed that under 768px the cards didn't look so great and too big. FIXING I add col-sm-6 to each div line 86, 96, 106, 117. Then I add a class resize to the div row on line 85 on my index.html, and applied a media queries adding margin left and right and removing padding left and right from container-fluid-meals class under 576 px. the resuld is that the cards take full weight screen only up to 576px, with padding left and right to center them all.
  
* I didn't design a wireframe for smarthpohne or tablet as initially I thought to give the same structure in diffent dimension, I then readapt each section to the screen size.

    ![Validator-HTML](/docs/contact-xs-screenshoot.png)

    ![Validator-HTML](/docs/footer-xs-screenshot.png)

* In the varieties section one of the name given as h3 varieties heading was too long causing the images and text to be moved down on xs device, I just change the name to be shorter as a temporary but visually good solution.

* On XS device in the benefit section the two pictures were in colon line, I didn't like to much so I decide to use media queries to make one of the images disapper.

* Another media queries has been used for the cover text id to make the container of different size on xs screen.

* Start to validate the index.html file on [The W3C Markup Validation Service](<https://validator.w3.org/>)  , and have multiple info, Error, or Warning to fix. 
  * INFO line 9 :  Trailing slash on void elements. FIXING removing / simbol.
  * ERROR line 99 : Bad value assets/img/full _aperitivo.jpg for attribute src on element img. FIXING change the name of the img in full-aperitivo.
  * WARNING line 146 : Possible misuse of aria-label. FIXING removing aria-label.
  * WARNING line 170 : Possible misuse of aria-label. FIXING  removing aria-label.
  * ERROR line line 204, 215, 226, 237, 248, 259 : Duplicate ID central-image. FIXING changing all the ID central-image with class:central-image.
  * ERROR line line 205, 216, 227, 238, 249, 260 : Duplicate ID circle-container. FIXING changing all the ID circle-container with class:circle-container.
  * ERRORS line 269 : End tag section seen, but there were open elements. line 196, 197 : Unclosed element div. FIXING I checked the varieties section related to the errors and fixed the position of the element.
  * INFO line 286, 287 : Trailing slash on void elements. FIXING remove / symbol at the end of the tag from line 286, 287.
  * ERRORS line 301 End tag section seen, but there were open elements; line 276 : Unclosed element div. FIXING add closing div /div to line 304 in index.html.
  
    After fixing these errors I got the following message "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show." from W3C .

    ![Validator-HTML](/docs/screenshot-validator-html.png)


* Now validate the style.css on [The W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw](<https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/>)

  * ERROR line 317 .varieties-heading	Value Error : margin-bottom only 0 can be a unit. You must put a unit after your number : 1.5. FIXING add rem to 1.5 value.

    After fixing the error I got the following message "Congratulations! No Error Found." from W3C . There are some warnings needed to be fixed related to the browser transiction.
  
    ![Validator-CSS](/docs/screenshot-css-validator.png)


## Unfixed bugs

The hero image under 992px as a margin on the right, the page scroll on the right and there is this margin of a few pixel that considering the deadline of the project I can't fix at the moment.
